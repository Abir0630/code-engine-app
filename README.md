## Overview

This project is part of a hands-on course offered by **IBM**, guiding learners through the process of deploying applications using **Gradio** and **IBM Code Engine**. The course, led by **Sina Nazeri**, provided the essential code and step-by-step instructions to successfully complete this project.

The journey began with understanding the importance of **container images** and **containers** for isolating and running applications in different environments. As part of the practical steps, I created a container image by assembling key files:

- `demo.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Dockerfile`

After testing the components locally to ensure smooth functionality, I deployed the application using **Docker**.

### IBM Code Engine Deployment Process

IBM Code Engine played a key role in hosting the containerized workload, streamlining the deployment process by handling infrastructure complexities. The final steps involved:  
1. Building and pushing the container image to the IBM **Container Registry**.  
2. Deploying the application via **IBM Code Engine**.  
3. Making the app publicly accessible through a URL.

This seamless integration of **Gradio, Docker**, and **IBM Code Engine** showcased the power of modern cloud technologies and simplified deployment workflows.

## Conclusion

This hands-on project provided me with invaluable knowledge and practical experience in deploying applications in a cloud environment. The skills I gained—ranging from working with containers to leveraging IBM's cloud resources—are essential in today’s technology landscape. 

I look forward to using these skills in future projects and professional opportunities!
